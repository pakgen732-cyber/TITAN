# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##     - "Task name 1"

##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      ✅ CSS FIX VERIFICATION COMPLETE - TEXT GRADIENT WORKING PERFECTLY
      
      Tested CSS fix for .text-gradient class visibility issue (solid gold bar → readable gradient text)
      
      DASHBOARD VERIFICATION (/dashboard):
      ✅ Current Level Card: "Level 1" displays as readable gold-white gradient text
      ✅ Current Level Benefits Card: "Level 1" in Level row displays correctly
      ✅ Current Level Benefits Card: "Level 1" in Package row displays correctly
      ✅ Next Level Progress Card: "Level 2" as Target Level displays correctly
      
      INVEST PAGE VERIFICATION (/staking):
      ✅ Package price range: "$50.00 - $15,000.00" displays as readable gradient text
      ✅ All gradient text elements properly configured (100% success rate)
      
      TECHNICAL VERIFICATION:
      ✅ CSS properly uses background-image instead of background shorthand
      ✅ background-clip: text is correctly applied
      ✅ -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent is correctly applied
      ✅ No solid gold bar issues detected anywhere
      
      Verified gradient styles:
      - backgroundImage: linear-gradient(135deg, rgb(255,255,255) 0%, rgb(212,175,55) 50%, rgb(255,255,255) 100%)
      - backgroundClip: text
      - webkitBackgroundClip: text
      - webkitTextFillColor: rgba(0,0,0,0)
      
      FIX STATUS: ✅ VERIFIED AND WORKING
      The CSS fix in /app/TITAN/frontend/src/index.css successfully resolved the text visibility issue.
